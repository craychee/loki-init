All bow down and tremble before me.

## Getting Started... I guess.

------------------

I am not sure why you would want this but it's pretty simple:

```bash
# Copy this down into Terminal and
/PATH/TO/LOKI-INIT/install_loki.sh
```
and you have everything you need to work the way I do.

## What is this?

------------------

You are looking at my `zsh` aliases, my `vim` and `tmux` configs, and list
of necessities to get me developing quickly on a fresh install.
